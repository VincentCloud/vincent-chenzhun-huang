# About
I am a 2022 graduate from McGill University with a Bachelor's degree in Honours Computer Science and a minor in Musical Science & Technology and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University in the MIIS (Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems) program. 

My technical background contains a combination of research and development. During my past internship, I have built internal tools that significantly accelerate the team's workflow. I also developed tools that helped automate repetitive work in a fashion studio. My research experience covers text summarization and knowledge distillation in pose authoring networks.

When I am not coding, I am a guitarist, singer, bass, piano and harmonica enthusiast;D. I am also an intermediate badminton player.
